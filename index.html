              I come from an artistic background, as I originally studied
              Animation in Cape Town South Africa and graduated with a Diploma
              in digital art. Throughout my career, I have learnt something
              about myself, and that's that I really enjoyed problem solving. It
              was at this point I taught myself to code, as I was interested in
              automating some of the tasks in my day-to-day activities, and
              found I really enjoyed it. I have a continuous learning attitude,
              and love problem-solving. Although I do enjoy the Animation
              industy, I am ready to embark on a new challenge and new career. I
              have since grown a passion for being a developer, and strive to be
              the best developer I can be.
